AI is not only transforming food production but also optimizing supply chains to reduce losses and ensure food reaches consumers efficiently.

    Twiga Foods in Kenya leverages AI-driven logistics to connect small farmers directly with urban retailers, cutting post-harvest losses from 30% to just 4% (World Bank, 2022) by optimizing supply routes and market demand predictions.
    Governments and humanitarian organizations are using machine learning models to forecast food shortages (FAO, 2023) up to 30 days in advance, allowing proactive intervention in food-insecure regions.

By integrating AI into both farming and food distribution, significant advancements have been made in optimizing logistics, reducing losses, and improving food accessibility. For example, in Kenya, Twiga Foods has successfully implemented AI-powered logistics to streamline supply chains, enabling small farmers to directly connect with retailers (World Bank, 2022). Similarly, in India, AI-driven predictive models help manage food inventories, ensuring efficient distribution and reducing waste (FAO, 2023). These case studies highlight how AI integration is not just a technological innovation but a practical solution to pressing food security challenges in the Global South. With these advancements, we can enhance agricultural resilience against climate change while ensuring food reaches those who need it most.
